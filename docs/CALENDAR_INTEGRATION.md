# Calendar Integration

Layers has a calendar connection flow for showing upcoming meetings before
recording starts.

## API Contract

- `GET /api/calendar/upcoming?limit=3`
- `GET /api/calendar/connect/google`
- `GET /api/calendar/connect/outlook`
- `GET /api/calendar/callback/[provider]`
- `POST /api/calendar/disconnect/[provider]`

## Supabase Setup

Apply:

```bash
supabase db push
```

Or paste `supabase/migrations/00004_calendar_connections.sql` into the Supabase
SQL editor.

The table is `calendar_connections`. OAuth tokens are encrypted by the app and
written only through the service-role client; browser clients never write token
fields directly.

## Environment Setup

Add these values locally and in production:

```bash
CALENDAR_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=replace-with-a-long-random-secret

GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET=...

MICROSOFT_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID=...
MICROSOFT_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

OAuth redirect URLs:

```text
http://localhost:3001/api/calendar/callback/google
http://localhost:3001/api/calendar/callback/outlook
https://your-production-domain.com/api/calendar/callback/google
https://your-production-domain.com/api/calendar/callback/outlook
```

Google scopes:

```text
openid email https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly
```

Microsoft scopes:

```text
openid email offline_access User.Read Calendars.Read
```

## Runtime Behavior

If no calendar is connected, the home screen shows a compact connect action.

If a calendar is connected, `/api/calendar/upcoming` decrypts the access token,
refreshes it when needed, and fetches the next events from Google Calendar or
Microsoft Graph. If the dedicated `calendar_connections` table is not ready,
the MVP fallback uses Supabase's Google `session.provider_token` when the user
signed in with Calendar read scope.

The base Google sign-in buttons request:

```text
openid email profile https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly
```

If credentials, the encryption key, or a valid provider token are missing, the
UI stays usable and points the user back to Settings.

## Product Behavior

- The recorder now uses the next usable calendar event title as the meeting
  title when creating a live recording session.
- Upcoming meeting rows show the event time, attendee count, and a "Record
  this" action that selects that event before starting recording.
- Autosave and finalize preserve that title so the completed note keeps the
  user's calendar context instead of being overwritten by a generic generated
  title.
- Settings uses the next upcoming calendar event to offer exact recording
  reminders at the start, 5 minutes before, or 15 minutes before the meeting.

## Next Product Steps

- Add destination-authenticated follow-up pushes after the MCP client-pulled
  notes package has been validated in real Claude flows.
