# Native Release Readiness

Owner: Agent D, Native Release Prep
Last updated: 2026-05-09
Scope: iOS TestFlight and Google Play internal testing prep without Apple or Google account credentials.

Repository note: the root `.gitignore` ignores `/ios/` and `/android/`. Native changes in those directories exist on disk but will not appear in normal `git status`; commit them with an explicit force-add or update the ignore policy when native artifacts are meant to be tracked.

## Evidence Contract

Native/release status is not inferred from build output alone. The harness uses
these evidence files:

| Command | Evidence | Release meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pnpm runner:doctor` | `.evidence/runner-capability.json` | Runner readiness only. |
| `pnpm native:providers` | `.evidence/native-provider-readiness.json` | Which local, Mac, Android, and device-cloud proof paths are ready or blocked. |
| `pnpm test:native:config` | `.evidence/native-config.json` | Static Capacitor/bundle/deep-link config proof only. |
| `pnpm test:native:smoke` | `.evidence/native-smoke.json` | Passing native proof only when a real device, emulator, simulator, or approved device cloud run records device identity, screenshot, video, and run URL/log evidence. A skipped file is pending coordination evidence, not proof. |
| `pnpm native:record-smoke` | `.evidence/native-smoke.json` | Copy-back command for external device proof. |
| `pnpm build:release` | `.evidence/release-artifacts.json` | Artifact discovery, reviewable internal artifact proof, or production release readiness depending on explicit signing/notarization/upload/review fields. |
| `pnpm native:evidence-index` | `.evidence/native-evidence-index.json` | Reviewer-facing index of native evidence files, commands, statuses, and proof boundaries. |
| `pnpm native:handoff` | `.evidence/native-device-handoff.json` | Copy-back runbook for Mac, Android, BrowserStack, Firebase Test Lab, Maestro Cloud, AWS Device Farm, and release runner paths. |

`reviewable-internal-artifact` means an artifact can be inspected through the
dashboard. It does not mean signed, notarized, uploaded, install-tested, or
production-approved unless those fields are explicitly true.

`native-provider-readiness.json` uses `pass=true` only when at least one native
proof provider path is ready. A blocked scan still exits successfully when not
required so the dashboard can record the blocker, but the artifact remains
`status=blocked` and `pass=false`.

## Current Metadata

### iOS

| Field | Current value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Display name | `Layers` | `ios/App/App/Info.plist` |
| Bundle ID | `com.mirrorfactory.layers` | `ios/App/App.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`, `capacitor.config.ts` |
| Version | `1.0` | `MARKETING_VERSION` |
| Build | `1` | `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` |
| Team ID | `36J9E4325G` | Xcode project signing settings |
| Deployment target | `15.0` | Xcode project build settings |
| Microphone copy | `Layers needs microphone access to record and transcribe your meetings.` | `Info.plist` |
| Privacy manifest | `ios/App/App/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` | Added to the app target resources |

The initial privacy manifest declares email address, user ID, audio data, and other user content as linked to the user, used for app functionality, and not used for tracking. Alfonso/legal still needs to reconcile this against App Store Connect App Privacy answers for calendar data, billing/subscription metadata, diagnostics, analytics, and any future third-party SDK manifests.

### Android

| Field | Current value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App label | `Layers` | `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` |
| Package/application ID | `com.mirrorfactory.layers` | `android/app/build.gradle`, `AndroidManifest.xml` |
| Version name | `1.0` | `android/app/build.gradle` |
| Version code | `1` | `android/app/build.gradle` |
| Min SDK | `24` | `android/variables.gradle` |
| Compile/target SDK | `36` / `36` | `android/variables.gradle` |
| Release artifact | `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab` | Gradle `bundleRelease` |

## iOS TestFlight Path

Prerequisites Alfonso must complete:

- Apple Developer Program membership and App Store Connect access.
- App Store Connect app record for `Layers`.
- Bundle ID `com.mirrorfactory.layers` registered under the Apple Developer team.
- Signing/provisioning access for team `36J9E4325G`, or update the Xcode project to the correct team ID.
- Final privacy policy URL, terms URL, support URL/email, app category, age rating, encryption/export compliance answer, and App Privacy nutrition labels.
- Account deletion and recording consent surfaces reviewed before wider TestFlight or App Review.

Before every upload, increment the build number from `1` to a new integer in Xcode or in `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`.

Archive from CLI:

```bash
pnpm exec cap sync ios
mkdir -p build/ios
xcodebuild \
  -project ios/App/App.xcodeproj \
  -scheme App \
  -configuration Release \
  -destination "generic/platform=iOS" \
  -archivePath "$PWD/build/ios/Layers.xcarchive" \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  clean archive
```

Upload directly to App Store Connect with an App Store Connect API key:

```bash
cat > /tmp/Layers-TestFlight-ExportOptions.plist <<'PLIST'
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

</plist>
PLIST

xcodebuild \
  -exportArchive \
  -archivePath "$PWD/build/ios/Layers.xcarchive" \
  -exportPath "$PWD/build/ios/export" \
  -exportOptionsPlist /tmp/Layers-TestFlight-ExportOptions.plist \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  -authenticationKeyPath "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH" \
  -authenticationKeyID "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID" \
  -authenticationKeyIssuerID "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID"
```

Xcode UI alternative:

1. Open `ios/App/App.xcodeproj`.
2. Select scheme `App` and a generic iOS device destination.
3. Confirm signing team, bundle ID, version, and build.
4. Run `Product > Archive`.
5. In Organizer, select the archive and run `Validate App`.
6. Select `Distribute App > App Store Connect > Upload`.
7. Keep symbol upload enabled. Use `TestFlight Internal Testing Only` for the first internal build.
8. Wait for App Store Connect processing, then add the build to an internal TestFlight group.

App Store Connect tasks for Alfonso after upload:

- Create or select an internal tester group and add App Store Connect users.
- Add beta test information and release notes.
- Assign the processed build to the internal group.
- Complete App Privacy answers using the Xcode privacy report and final legal policy.
- Confirm encryption/export compliance.
- Add final screenshots, app description, keywords, category, support URL, privacy URL, and terms URL before App Review.

## Android Internal Testing Path

Release signing is configured in `android/app/build.gradle` from environment variables. Without all four variables, Gradle keeps the release build type unsigned.

Required signing environment:

```bash
export LAYERS_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH="$HOME/.android/layers-upload.jks"
export LAYERS_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD="..."
export LAYERS_ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS="layers-upload"
export LAYERS_ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD="..."
```

Create an upload keystore if Alfonso has not created one:

```bash
keytool -genkeypair \
  -v \
  -keystore "$HOME/.android/layers-upload.jks" \
  -storetype JKS \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000 \
  -alias layers-upload
```

Do not commit the keystore or passwords. Back up the keystore in a password manager or secure vault.

Build the signed AAB:

```bash
pnpm exec cap sync android
cd android
./gradlew clean :app:bundleRelease
ls -lh app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

Play Console tasks for Alfonso:

- Create the Play app record for `Layers`.
- Confirm package name `com.mirrorfactory.layers` before first upload; Google fixes the package name after the first artifact.
- Configure Play App Signing. Use the generated upload key for the AAB upload unless Alfonso has an existing app signing strategy.
- Complete app content requirements: Data Safety, privacy policy URL, content rating, target audience, ads declaration, and app access instructions.
- Go to `Testing > Internal testing`, create or select a tester email list, and add up to 100 testers.
- Create an internal testing release, upload `app-release.aab`, add release notes, review, and roll out.
- Share the Play internal testing opt-in link with testers after the release is available.

## Android Permissions And Recording Blocker

Current `AndroidManifest.xml` permissions:

- `android.permission.INTERNET`
- `android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`
- `android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS`
- `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS`
- `android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`

No foreground recording service is implemented in `android/app/src/main/java`, and the manifest does not declare:

- `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE`
- `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE`
- A `<service>` with `android:foregroundServiceType="microphone"`

Blocker: if Android recording must continue while the app is backgrounded, screen-locked, or otherwise not visible, the app needs a real native foreground service with a persistent notification and microphone foreground service type. I did not add one because there is no existing native service pattern in the project. If recording is foreground-only inside the Capacitor WebView, the existing `RECORD_AUDIO` path may be enough, but it still needs physical-device testing for permission prompts, app switching, screen lock, incoming calls, and notification behavior.

## Targeted Checks

Run before handoff when local toolchains are available:

```bash
pnpm test:native:config
plutil -lint ios/App/App/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy
xcodebuild -project ios/App/App.xcodeproj -list
cd android
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
./gradlew :app:bundleRelease
```

`bundleRelease` requires the four `LAYERS_ANDROID_*` signing variables for a Play-ready signed artifact.

Current check results on 2026-04-30:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `plutil -lint ios/App/App/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` | Pass |
| `plutil -lint ios/App/App/Info.plist` | Pass |
| `xcodebuild -project ios/App/App.xcodeproj -list` | Pass; scheme `App` is visible |
| `xmllint --noout android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` | Pass |
| `pnpm test:native:config` | Pass on 2026-05-09 after aligning Capacitor, Android, iOS, release workflow, and OAuth deep-link scheme to `com.mirrorfactory.layers` |
| `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` | Blocked; local Java runtime is missing |
| `./gradlew :app:bundleRelease` | Blocked; local Java runtime is missing |
