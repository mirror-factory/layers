            DELETE before the app removes your account.

          If you have an active paid subscription, cancel it through the
          billing or app-store channel where it was purchased. Account deletion

          removes the Supabase authentication user. It does not delete Stripe
          invoices, tax records, chargeback records, external app store
          records, or provider logs we must retain for legal, security,
          billing, or fraud-prevention reasons.
