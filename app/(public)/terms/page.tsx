      <LegalSection id="review-status" title="Launch draft - legal review pending">
        <p>
          This is practical launch copy, not final legal advice. Counsel should
          review liability, governing law, warranty, arbitration, app-store,
          and business-entity language before production launch.

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="rules" title="Rules of use">
        <p>
          The headings below set the working rules for Layers during this
          launch period. Each one applies to every account and every meeting
          you process through the service.

          <div key={term.title}>

      <LegalSection id="your-content" title="Your content">
        <p>
          You keep the rights you already have in your meeting audio,
          transcripts, notes, summaries, uploads, and exports. You grant Layers
          the permission needed to host, process, transform, display, search,
          export, and transmit that content to provide the service.
        </p>
        <p>
          You represent that you have the rights, notices, consents, and
          authorizations needed for any content you add to Layers.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="third-party" title="Third-party services and integrations">
        <p>
          Layers depends on infrastructure, authentication, calendar,
          transcription, model, email, payment, app-store, and integration
          providers. Their terms and privacy practices may apply when you
          connect or use those services.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="privacy-deletion" title="Privacy and deletion">
        <p>
          The <Link href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link> explains what Layers
          collects and how it is used. Account deletion requests are handled
          through the <Link href="/account-deletion">account deletion page</Link>.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="termination" title="Suspension and termination">
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate access if an account creates security
          risk, violates these terms, creates payment risk, infringes rights,
          or could expose Layers, Mirror Factory, users, or providers to legal
          or operational harm.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="disclaimers" title="Disclaimers and liability">
        <p>
          Layers is provided as-is during launch and early testing. To the
          maximum extent permitted by law, Mirror Factory disclaims implied
          warranties and is not responsible for indirect, incidental, special,
          consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Final warranty, liability cap, jurisdiction, dispute resolution, and
          consumer-law language needs counsel review before production release.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="changes" title="Changes">
        <p>
          We may update these terms as Layers, platform requirements, and
          launch operations change. We will update the date above and, when
          appropriate, provide additional notice.
