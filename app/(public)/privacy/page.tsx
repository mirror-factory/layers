          Layers uses service providers to operate the app. Meeting content may
          be sent to transcription and AI model providers only as needed to
          produce the product features you request. Provider settings,
          subprocessors, and retention commitments need final legal review
          before production launch.

      <LegalSection id="consent" title="Recording consent">
        <p>
          Layers is a bot-free recorder. That does not remove consent or notice
          obligations. You are responsible for telling participants when a
          meeting is being recorded and for following recording, privacy,
          employment, and confidentiality laws that apply to your conversations.

      <LegalSection id="sharing" title="Sharing">
        <p>
          We do not sell your personal information or meeting content. We share
          information with service providers, connected integrations you
          authorize, billing and support systems, and when required for
          security, legal compliance, or protection of rights.

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="retention" title="Retention and deletion">
        <p>
          We keep account data, meeting content, and derived meeting memory
          while your account is active or while needed to provide Layers,
          unless you delete data or request account deletion. Some records may
          be retained when needed for security, fraud prevention, payment, tax,
          legal, backup, or dispute purposes.

        <p>
          Account deletion requests are handled through the{" "}
          <Link href="/account-deletion">account deletion page</Link>. Full
          self-serve destructive deletion is a launch follow-up and should not
          be treated as legal-approved until reviewed.

        <p>
          Layers uses authentication, row-level database controls, limited
          access patterns, and operational logging to protect user data. No
          online service can guarantee absolute security, so report suspected
