## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **AI Starter Kit v0.0.11** — installed the current local package, added the new starter/control-plane routes, manifests, hooks, scripts, evidence flow, and Claude/Codex runtime configuration.
- **Claude MCP testing guide** — added `docs/CLAUDE_MCP_TESTING.md` with Claude.ai custom connector, Claude Code, OAuth, API-key, and MCP App preview instructions.
- **Claude MCP App UI** — added `show_meeting_dashboard` plus a `text/html;profile=mcp-app` resource so Claude can render a read-only interactive recent-meetings dashboard from the MCP server.
- **MCP OAuth hardening** — added consent, PKCE S256 auth codes, one-hour OAuth access tokens, rotating hashed refresh tokens, and token revocation for Claude-style MCP connectors.
- **Competitive landscape and GTM plan** — added `docs/COMPETITIVE_LANDSCAPE_AND_GTM.md` with current AI notetaker pricing, transcription provider economics, ICP selection, positioning, and a staged plan for 10, 100, and 1,000 paying customers.
- **Live recording preflight** — added `/api/transcribe/stream/preflight` plus recorder readiness checks for mic support, quota, provider configuration, active cost source, and runtime model status.
- **Local recording draft safety net** — live recording now mirrors transcript turns to local storage, keeps a device-local draft when autosave/finalize fails, and clears the draft after successful finalization.
- **Meeting intelligence panel** — completed meeting pages now surface decisions, intake signals, and next actions before transcript/chat.
- **Recording reliability docs** — `docs/RECORDING_RELIABILITY.md` documents the fast-start path, preflight contract, session states, local draft behavior, and browser testing caveats.
- **V1 execution plan** — `docs/V1_PLAN.md` defines the sprint order, API/tool/MCP/data/UI/native testing layers, optimization work, polish pass, and V1 definition of done.
- **Contract test foundation** — added API route inventory contracts, AI tool metadata/handler tests, and MCP protocol/tool tests with dedicated `test:contracts`, `test:tools`, and `test:mcp` scripts.
- **Runnable API smoke harness** — replaced the missing `start-server-and-test` dependency with `scripts/run-api-smoke.mjs`, added route behavior tests, and documented MCP/API testing in `docs/MCP_AND_API.md`.
- **Meeting detail chat** — completed meeting pages now include a meeting-scoped AI chat panel with Sales, Interview, and Standup templates grounded through `getMeetingDetails`.
- **App Store screenshot set** — added five editable marketing screenshots covering fast capture, private recording, intake notes, library chat, and provider-cost controls.
- **Release feature matrix** — added `docs/FEATURE_TEST_MARKETING_MATRIX.md` as the combined QA, feature inventory, screenshot asset, and marketing-pillar source of truth.
- **Current release screenshots** — added iPhone, iPad, and App Store benefit screenshot sets for the 2026-04-29 release pass.
- **Calendar OAuth setup** — added Google/Outlook connect, callback, disconnect, encrypted token storage, token refresh, and upcoming-event fetching for the home calendar panel.
- **Calendar-aware recording context** — live recordings now inherit the next calendar event title through token creation, autosave, finalize, and local drafts.
- **Calendar-aware recording reminders** — Settings can schedule recording reminders from fixed presets or from the next connected calendar event.
- **Unified Ask surface** — added `/ask` as the combined meeting-memory page for chat-style questions and exact search.
- **Mobile primary navigation** — added bottom navigation for Record, Library, and Ask on phone-sized layouts.
- **MCP notes push package** — added a read-only `prepare_notes_push` MCP tool that returns an explicit, destination-labeled notes payload without transmitting private notes.
- **Meeting notes package API/UI** — completed meetings now expose a copyable notes package built from the same shared source as MCP, with transcript inclusion kept opt-in.
- **Settings integrations panel** — added `/settings#integrations` with agent-access links, webhook registration, event selection, optional signing secrets, and delete controls.
- **Notes push workflow docs** — added `docs/NOTES_PUSH_WORKFLOW.md` to define the shared builder, safety rules, user component, API contract, and tests.
- **Webhook delivery visibility** — added recent delivery listing for user webhooks plus a Supabase migration for webhook destinations and delivery logs.
- **Local meeting chat fallback** — completed meeting chat can now answer from saved notes, actions, decisions, intake fields, and transcript segments when no AI model is configured.
- **Recorder voice commands** — live recording now recognizes "Hey Layers" commands, removes the last transcript segment on scratch/remove requests, and passes action-style commands as private note-generation directives.
- **MCP App visual polish** — updated the Claude MCP dashboard preview to use the current Layers pastel/glass visual language.

### Fixed

- **Recent recording cleanup** — tightened the home recent-recording rows, changed them to one consistent recording glyph with soft accent variants, and added a guarded delete action for empty zero-minute recordings.
- **Home palette/frame consistency** — rounded the full app frame, shortened the pastel backing surface, and softened the recorder ribbon ridges so the light home direction stays smoother.
- **Base live STT default** — made AssemblyAI Universal Streaming Multilingual the active $0.15/hr live default by removing automatic realtime diarization from pricing defaults and cost estimation.
- **Codex microphone confusion** — recorder errors now distinguish normal browser permission blocks from embedded-browser microphone limitations.
- **Recent recording status noise** — completed recordings no longer show redundant status text, while in-progress untitled recordings read as "Writing notes..." in the title.
- **MCP auth scoping** — removed module-level authenticated-user state from the MCP route so tool handlers close over the validated user for each request.
- **Default STT cost routing** — changed default batch STT to Universal-2 and default streaming STT to Universal Streaming, with shared defaults across settings, AssemblyAI resolution, and cost estimation.
- **Webhook event matching** — webhook delivery now matches the exact subscribed event and records failed fetch attempts in delivery logs.
- **Meeting chat auth** — valid chat requests now require an authenticated user instead of silently continuing as an anonymous chat session.

### Changed

- **UI audit polish loop** — captured desktop/mobile contact sheets, hid the dev toolbar from normal app UI, tightened mobile capture scale, made Settings model pricing readable, and softened Search/Chat language.
- **Desktop home layout** — changed the signed-in home screen to a three-column desktop layout, removed the quick-action buttons under the recorder, and dropped the confusing top status pills.
- **Second-concept app design** — applied the matte graphite/mint command-center direction across live recording, meeting library, semantic search, chat, transcript cards, reminders, and shared app chrome.
- **User-facing polish pass** — removed provider, cost, MCP, and debug-style wording from the main recording, meetings, search, and chat surfaces so the app reads like a polished meeting product instead of an engineering dashboard.
- **Mobile recording scale** — simplified the phone recording screen around one primary capture surface, a compact readiness summary, and notes only after speech starts.
- **Home recorder redesign** — replaced the signed-in home page's cluttered top card with a quieter recording dock, compact status, and lighter quick-action strip.
- **Public home hero redesign** — replaced the oversized landing hero with a calmer meeting-intake pitch, compact capture preview, tighter mobile scale, and clearer first action.
- **App-shell navigation** — replaced the user-facing hamburger with an account/settings gear; the drawer now stays focused on account items while admin/docs/roadmap/observability remain direct-URL operator surfaces.
- **Claude MCP App polish** — tightened the meeting dashboard UI, added standalone preview mode, and documented Supabase OAuth migration setup.
- **Meeting chat grounding** — meeting-scoped chat now includes transcript segment IDs and prompts the assistant to cite those segments when making factual claims.
- **Meeting chat resilience** — meeting-scoped chat now uses saved meeting context first and falls back to instant local answers instead of failing hard when model credentials are unavailable.
- **Pricing admin conversion labels** — the STT provider panel now shows 30-minute, Core-cap, and 1,000-user cost conversions for faster margin decisions.
- **Recorder atmosphere** — restored animated line visuals on the home and live recording screens, and removed reminder cards from the primary capture flow.
- **Paper Calm UI direction** — moved the default capture experience toward the selected light, soft-green direction with a simpler mobile recorder, warmer desktop backdrop, and calmer foreground cards.
- **Live desktop recording workspace** — active recording now shifts into a left capture panel with timer/details and a right live transcript panel, while shared app pages inherit the Paper Calm shell and transparent navigation.
- **Signed-in home copy** — replaced the oversized "Capture without ceremony" headline with a compact date/time treatment above the recorder.
- **Layers reference UI match** — refreshed the signed-in home shell to follow the supplied desktop/mobile screens with a rounded app frame, reference-style three-column desktop layout, calendar connect art, quieter recent recordings, and a procedural audio ribbon.
- **Layers reference detail polish** — softened the audio ribbon with larger edge fades and subtle dot/star texture, added animated dotted calendar orbit details, removed noisy recent-row play/readiness pills, flattened the recorder nav chrome, and matched desktop frame heights across the three-column home layout.
- **Home clock polish** — balanced the recorder card spacing and changed the primary clock to lighter typography with smaller live seconds.
- **Recorder ribbon motion** — increased the home ribbon's idle drift, ridge pulse, and breathing motion while keeping reduced-motion support.
- **Calendar event date tiles** — upcoming meetings on the home screen now show compact calendar-style date tiles beside each connected event.
- **Live workspace actions** — active recording now includes a meeting context card plus functional transcript, key point, action, decision, and question views generated from the live transcript.
- **Live recording workspace simplification** — tightened the active recording frame, narrowed the capture panel, moved timer/stop/live above the animated ribbon, simplified the context card, and flattened live transcript rows into a cleaner note stream.
- **Responsive home side panels** — compacted the calendar connect art at tablet/mobile widths and replaced colorful recent-recording icons with neutral duration/status markers.
- **Dark home palette alignment** — tuned the signed-in home dark mode to use a dimmed lilac/mint paper palette instead of a separate slate-blue scheme.
- **Home motion polish** — added restrained route/page entrance choreography and changed the home date label from a capsule into lighter, larger inline text.
- **Home illustration polish** — cleaned the recorder ribbon into a smoother organic three-line wave, added custom empty-state art for no recordings, and replaced the capture card icon badge with a lightweight contextual illustration.
- **Home desktop width cap** — constrained the signed-in home frame and wide-screen columns so the three-card layout holds its intended scale instead of stretching across large monitors.
- **Home recorder polish** — hid the idle recording timer, changed the ready microphone state to "Start recording", made stale zero-minute recent rows deletable with consistent duration markers, clarified the right-rail outcome card, and added smoother rail/capture transitions into live recording.
- **Note-first meeting detail** — meeting pages now put Summary, Decisions, and Actions before the transcript and chat, with cost details kept last.
- **Mobile navigation scope** — bottom navigation is limited to top-level Record, Library, and Ask surfaces so detail/settings pages stay focused.
- **Notes handoff architecture** — MCP, API, and meeting detail handoffs now share `lib/notes-push.ts` so future integrations do not fork package formatting.
- **Completed-meeting webhooks** — `meeting.completed` deliveries now include the compact notes package with summary, decisions, actions, and intake context while keeping transcript text out of webhook payloads.
